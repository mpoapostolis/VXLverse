DAY 1

"Sleep, the cousin of death, visits us each night."

[John wakes up, looks at himself in the mirror]

John: "Another day..."

[John heads to the kitchen, there's a note on the fridge]

Note: "Don't forget to pick up your repaired watch from Emma at the convenience store."

Objective: Retrieve your watch from the convenience store.

[John heads to the convenience store]

Emma: "John! Here's your watch, good as new. I still don't understand how you keep breaking it."

John: "Thanks, Emma. I wish I knew."

[John heads back home, does a few tasks around the house, then goes to bed]

DAY 2

"Yet, each morning, we rise with the memory of yesterday intact."

[John wakes up. There's a brief flashback of darkness and a feeling of being trapped. He shakes it off as a bad dream.]

[John opens the door, NPC named Mark is there]

Mark: "Hey John, did you forget about our fishing trip today?"

John: "Fishing trip? I don't remember... but sure, let's go."

Objective: Go fishing with Mark

[They head to the local lake and fish for a while]

Mark: "Remember the last time we were here, John? When you fell into the water trying to reel in that big catch?"

John: "I... don't remember that."

[John heads back home, somewhat troubled. He finds an old wet and torn fishing hat that he doesn't remember. John then goes to bed]

DAY 3

"These memories, echoes of a past self, linger in our minds, but who are we truly?"

[John wakes up, there's a phone call. The memory of being trapped in darkness is stronger now, but he dismisses it again.]

Caller (Sarah): "John, have you seen the painting you left at my studio? It's absolutely brilliant!"

John: "Painting? Sarah, I don't remember..."

Objective: Go to Sarah's studio

[John goes to the studio, sees a beautiful painting that he doesn't remember creating]

Sarah: "You really outdid yourself this time, John."

[John returns home, perplexed and somewhat frightened. He goes to bed]

DAY 4

"In a world where memory survives death, who could ever know the boundaries of their existence?"

[John wakes up, he seems restless. He has another brief flashback, a glimpse of being inside a coffin. He quickly dismisses it as a bad dream.]

John: "Those strange things... I need answers."

[John heads to the kitchen, there's a new note on the fridge]

Note: "John, left some books for you at the library. - Peter"

Objective: Retrieve books from the library.

[John heads to the library]

Librarian (A different one from before): "John, Peter left some psychology books for you. He said you wanted to learn more about memory loss."

John: "Wasn't there another librarian working here yesterday?"

Librarian: "Yesterday? I've been working here for years."

[John retrieves the books, starts reading them throughout the day, then goes to bed]

DAY 5

"Are we simply vessels, carrying the past into the present, guided by memories not truly ours?"

[John wakes up. He has another flashback, this time clearer - he's trapped in a coffin.]

John: "These aren't just dreams. What's happening to me? I need to figure this out."

[Phone rings, it's Emma]

Emma: "John, I think you left your watch here again. Could you come and pick it up?"

John: "Again? Are you sure it's mine?"

Objective: Give the watch to Emma.

[John hands over the watch, even more puzzled, then goes to bed.]

DAY 6

"Every night we surrender to sleep, to death, only to awaken as though nothing has happened."

[John wakes up, the memory of the coffin is even clearer now - the sensation of confined space, the smell of earth.]

John: "I've...died. Is this what's happening to everyone?"

[Phone rings, it's Mark]

Mark: "John, are we up for another fishing trip? The weather's perfect."

John: "Mark, when we went fishing the other day...Did anything strange happen?"

Mark: "Strange? You seemed like yourself. Why?"

John: "I'm not sure... Just feeling a bit off, I guess."

[John spends the day in introspection, reading more from the books and contemplating his memories, then goes to bed.]

DAY 7

"In a world where yesterday's memories are today's reality, who can discern the transition? Who would care to question the dance of death and rebirth?"

[John wakes up and looks in the mirror]

John: "We're all dying... Every time we sleep, we die. We wake up with all the memories of the person before, living lives oblivious of our death."

Objective: Confront your friends with your findings.

[John heads out to meet Emma, Mark, and others to talk about his realizations. The reactions are mixed, with some dismissing it as nonsense and others being taken aback, as they too have felt odd occurrences.]
